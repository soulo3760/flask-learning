HTTP METHODS
web application use fifferent http methods when accessing URLs
you should familiarise yourself with the HTTP methods as you work with Flask. 
By default a route only answers to GET requests,. you can use the methods arguments of the route() decorator to handle diffeerent methods. 

from flask import requests
@app.route('/login', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def login():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        return do_the_login()
    else: 
        return show_the_login_form()
WE CAN ALSO SEPRATE THE VIEWS FROM DIFFERENT METHODS INTO DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS. 
flask provides a shortcut for decorating such routes with get() post() etc

@app.get('/login')
def login_get():
    return show_the_login_form()

@app.post('/login')
def login_post():
  return do_the_login()
