from flask import Flask
app = Flask(_name_)

@app.route("/")
def hello_world():
  return "<p> Hello, World!</p>"

# we have imported the Flask class 
next we have created an instance of this class
we then used the route() decorator ro tell flass what URL should trigger our function. 
the function returns the message we want to display on users browser. 
we save this file as hell0.py  

to run 
 flask --app hello run 
now head over to http://127.0.0.1:5000
you should see hello world greeting

if another program is using port 5000 we should get an error, 

to make it accessible to external users
flask run --host=0.0.0.0
this tells your operating system to listen to all public IPs.
